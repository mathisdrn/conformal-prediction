# Conformal Prediction

This repository hosts the code and markdown that present, implement and compare conformal predictions techniques applied to **regression** and **classification** tasks. The page is hosted at https://mathisdrn.github.io/conformal-prediction/.

### Usage

To run the code in this repository, you will need to create a Python environment with the dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml`.
You can do so by installing `uv` (instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)) and running `uv sync` in the repository root.

You can then run the notebooks using Jupyter or serve the markdown documents using `myst start`.
